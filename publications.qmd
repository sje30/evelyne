## Retinal development book


[Retinal Development, edited by E. Sernagor, S. Eglen, W. Harris, and
R. Wong. 2006.  Cambridge University Press.](files/draft_may8.pdf)

Evelyne was the lead editor on the textbook "Retinal Development",
published by Cambridge University Press (CUP) in September 2006.  Thanks to
our amazing editor, Katrina Halliday, we had a book launch in the CUP
store.  There was also a half-day symposium with talks from various
contributors.

CUP have kindly agree that we can share the PDF here, in memory of
Evelyne.  You can get it by clicking on the citation above.
