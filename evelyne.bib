               is crucial for refining visual connections. To study what aspects
               of this correlated activity are instructive, we must first
               understand how their dynamics change with development and what
               factors trigger their disappearance after birth. Here we report
               that in the turtle retina, GABA, rather than glutamate and
               acetylcholine, influences developmental changes in wave dynamics.
               Using calcium imaging of the ganglion cell layer, we report how
               waves switch from fast and broad, when they emerge, to slow and
               narrow a few days before hatching, coinciding with the emergence
               of excitatory GABA(A) receptor-mediated activity. Around
               hatching, waves gradually become stationary patches, whereas
               GABA(A) shifts from excitatory to inhibitory, coinciding with the
               upregulation of the cotransporter KCC2, suggesting that changes
               in intracellular chloride underlie the shift. Dark-rearing from
               hatching causes correlated spontaneous activity to persist,
               whereas GABA(A) responses remain excitatory, and KCC2 expression
               is weaker. We conclude that GABA plays an important regulatory
               role during the maturation of retinal neural activity. Using a
               simple and elegant mechanism, namely the switch from excitatory
               to inhibitory, GABA(A) receptor-mediated activity is necessary
               and sufficient to cause retinal waves to stop propagating,
               ultimately leading to the disappearance of correlated spontaneous
               activity. Moreover, our results suggest that visual experience
               modulates the GABAergic switch.",

               bring the first experimental evidence in vivo in the retina that
               chronic activation of GABA(A) receptors is necessary for the
               switch to occur and for the chloride extrusion mechanism (through
               the K+/Cl- cotransporter KCC2) to develop. Using a turtle model
               and calcium imaging, we investigated how chronic blockade of
               GABA(A) receptors with bicuculline during the period of the
               GABAergic polarity switch (from 1 week before hatching until 4
               weeks after hatching) influences developmental changes in the
               patterns of spontaneously generated electrical activity in the
               retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer. During that period,
               spontaneous activity normally switches from propagating waves to
               stationary patches of coactive cells, until correlated activity
               completely disappears. These changes in activity patterns
               coincide with the switch of GABA(A) responses from excitation to
               inhibition. When GABA(A) receptors are chronically blocked,
               GABA(A) responses remain excitatory and spontaneous waves keep
               propagating across the RGC layer. Concomitantly, the
               developmental upregulation of KCC2 is inhibited on dendritic
               processes in the inner plexiform layer, suggesting that the

               receptive field (RF) properties (e.g. responses to motion) remain
               to be deciphered. In this study, we have investigated whether
               motion anisotropies (non-homogeneities) characteristic of
               embryonic turtle RGCs arise from immature dendritic arborization
               in these cells. To test this hypothesis, we have looked at
               structure-function correlates of developing turtle RGCs from
               Stage 23 (S23) when light responses emerge, until 15 weeks
               post-hatching (PH). Using whole cell patch clamp recordings, RGCs
               were labelled with Lucifer Yellow (LY) while recording their
               responses to moving edges of light. Comparison of RF and
               dendritic arbor layouts revealed a weak correlation. To obtain a

               dendritic growth from S22 onwards, reaching peak proliferation at
               S25 (a week before hatching), while RGCs are still exhibiting
               significant motion anisotropies. Based on these observations, we
               suggest that immature anisotropic RGC RFs must originate from
               sparse synaptic inputs onto RGCs rather than from the immaturity
               of their growing dendritic trees.",

               Conversely, GABA reuptake transporters become operative later
               than glutamate transporters. GABA is therefore not removed
               efficiently from the extracellular domain and it can exert
               significant paracrine effects. Hence, GABA-mediated activity is a
               prominent source of overall neural activity in developing CNS
               networks, while neurons extend dendrites and axons, and establish
               synaptic connections. One of the unique features of GABAergic
               functional plasticity is that in early development, activation of
               GABA(A) receptors results in depolarizing (mainly excitatory)
               responses and Ca(2+) influx. Although there is strong evidence

               full supplementation under our photoreceptor-induction regimen
               achieve this within a significantly shorter time frame and show a

               highlight an important role for Dkk1 and Noggin in enhancing the

               and photoreceptor precursors during the early stages of

               by dark-rearing (Sernagor \& Grzywacz (1996)Curr. Biol., 6,
               1503-1508) promotes dendritic proliferation in large-field RGCs,
               an effect that is counteracted by exposure to curare from
               hatching. We also recorded spontaneous activity from individual
               RGCs labelled with lucifer yellow (LY). We found a tendency of
               RGCs with large dendritic fields to be spontaneously more active
               than small-field cells. From all these observations, we conclude
               that immature spontaneous activity promotes dendritic growth in
               developing RGCs.",

               transmission during retinal waves. Cell-intrinsic bursts decouple
               the retinal network through activation of the sAHP current, and

               and consisted of 60, 30 mum diameter electrodes at spacing of 200
               mum. These electrodes were coated via chemical vapor deposition
               of carbon nanotubes, resulting in conducting, three dimensional
               surfaces with a high interfacial area. These attributes are
               important both for the quality of the cell-surface coupling as
               well as for electro-chemical interfacing efficiency. The entire
               chip was packaged to fit a commercial multielectrode recording
               and stimulation system. Electrical recordings of spontaneous
               spikes from whole-mount neonatal mouse retinas were consistently
               obtained minutes after retinas were placed over the electrodes,
               exhibiting typical bursting and propagating waves. Most
               importantly, the signals obtained with carbon nanotube electrodes
               have exceptionally high signal to noise ratio, reaching values as
               high as 75. Moreover, spikes are marked by a conspicuous gradual

               suggesting improvement in cell-electrode coupling. This
               phenomenon is not observed in conventional commercial electrodes.
               Electrical stimulation using carbon nanotube electrodes was also

               GABA depolarizes and occasionally excites immature neurons,
               subsequently hyperpolarizing them at later stages of development.
               This sequence, which has been observed in a wide range of animal
               species, brain structures and preparations, is thought to play an
               important role in activity-dependent formation and modulation of

               reinforced recently with new data pointing to an evolutionary
               preserved rule. In a recent ``Hypothesis and Theory Article,''
               the excitatory action of GABA in early brain development is
               suggested to be ``an experimental artefact'' (Bregestovski and
               Bernard, 2012). The authors suggest that the excitatory action of
               GABA is due to an inadequate/insufficient energy supply in
               glucose-perfused slices and/or to the damage produced by the
               slicing procedure. However, these observations have been

               a large body of evidence including the fact that the
               developmental shift is neither restricted to slices nor to
               rodents. We summarize the overwhelming evidence in support of

               experience. The spatiotemporal patterns encoded in the waves are
               believed to be instructive for the wiring of functional
               connections throughout the visual system. However, the ontogeny
               of retinal waves is still poorly documented as a result of the
               relatively low resolution of conventional recording techniques.
               Here, we characterize the spatiotemporal features of mouse
               retinal waves from birth until eye opening in unprecedented
               detail using a large-scale, dense, 4096-channel multielectrode
               array that allowed us to record from the entire neonatal retina
               at near cellular resolution. We found that early cholinergic
               waves propagate with random trajectories over large areas with
               low ganglion cell recruitment. They become slower, smaller and
               denser when GABAA signalling matures, as occurs beyond postnatal
               day (P) 7. Glutamatergic influences dominate from P10, coinciding

               cease to be random and begin to show repetitive trajectories
               confined to a few localized hotspots. These hotspots gradually
               tile the retina with time, and disappear after eye opening. Our
               observations demonstrate that retinal waves undergo major
               spatiotemporal changes during ontogeny. Our results support the
               hypotheses that cholinergic waves guide the refinement of retinal

               GABA(A) signaling is depolarizing in ganglion cells, and at

               both cell types can give rise to retinal derivatives in the
               absence of inductive cues, this requires extended culture periods
               and gives lower overall yield. Further understanding of this
               innate differentiation ability, the identification of key factors

               functional neural retina is an important goal for clinical cell
               based therapies. We now report that insulin-like growth factor 1

               Here, we present a highly efficient, online capable spike

              prostheses currently represent the only clinically available
              vision-restoring treatment, but the quality of vision returned
              remains poor. Recently, it has been suggested that the
              pathological spontaneous hyperactivity present in dystrophic
              retinas may contribute to the poor quality of vision returned by
              retinal prosthetics by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio of
              prosthetic responses. Here, we investigated to what extent
              blocking this hyperactivity can improve optogenetic retinal
              prosthetic responses. We recorded activity from
              channelrhodopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells in retinal
              wholemounts in a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa.
              Sophisticated stimuli, inspired by those used in clinical visual

              retinal organoids. Despite this variability, by month 5 of
              differentiation, all iPSC-derived retinal organoids were able to

               radiance gallium nitride displays can be used with conventional
               virtual reality optics to stimulate an optogenetic retina. Hence,
               we aim to introduce a non-invasive approach to restore vision for
               people with conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa where there
               is a remaining viable communication link between the retina and
               the visual cortex. APPROACH: We design and implement the headset
               using a high-density µLED matrix, Raspberry Pi, microcontroller
               from NXP and virtual reality lens. Then, a test platform is
               developed to evaluate the performance of the headset and the
               optical system. Furthermore, image simplification algorithms are
               used to simplify the scene to be sent to the retina. Moreover, in
               vivo evaluation of the genetically modified retina response at
               different light intensity is discussed to prove the reliability
               of the proposed system. MAIN RESULTS: We demonstrate that in
               keeping with regulatory guidance, the headset displays need to
               limit their luminance to 90 kcd m-2. We demonstrate an optical
               system with 5.75\% efficiency which allows for 0.16 mW mm-2
               irradiance on the retina within the regulatory guidance, but
               which is capable of an average peak irradiance of 1.35 mW mm-2.
               As this is lower than the commonly accepted threshold for
               channelrhodopsin-2, we demonstrate efficacy through an optical
               model of an eye onto a biological retina. SIGNIFICANCE: We
               demonstrate a fully functional 8100-pixel headset system
               including software/hardware which can operate on a standard
               consumer battery for periods exceeding a 24 h recharge cycle. The
               headset is capable of delivering enough light to stimulate the
               genetically modified retina cells and also keeping the amount of
               light below the regulation threshold for safety.",

               markers or fluorescent reporter approaches and shown to have a

               prostheses are the best currently available vision-restoring
               treatment for RP, but only restore crude vision. One possible
               contributing factor to the poor quality of vision achieved with
               prosthetic devices is the pathological retinal ganglion cell
               (RGC) hyperactivity that occurs in photoreceptor dystrophic
               disorders. Gap junction blockade with meclofenamic acid (MFA) was
               recently shown to diminish RGC hyperactivity and improve the
               signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of RGC responses to light flashes and
               electrical stimulation in the rd10 mouse model of RP. We sought
               to extend these results to spatiotemporally patterned optogenetic
               stimulation in the faster-degenerating rd1 model and compare the

               (ChR2) in RGCs, allowing them to be stimulated directly using
               high-intensity blue light. We used 60-channel ITO multielectrode
               arrays to record ChR2-mediated RGC responses from wholemount,
               ex-vivo retinas to full-field and patterned stimuli before and
               after application of MFA, 18-β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18BGA,

               channel opener). All three drugs decreased spontaneous RGC
               firing, but 18BGA and Flu also decreased the sensitivity of RGCs
               to optogenetic stimulation. Nevertheless, all three drugs
               improved the SNR of ChR2-mediated responses. MFA also made it

               RGC coding strategies, results in salamander suggest that the
               relative latencies of a RGC pair encode spatial information.
               Thus, a population code based on this concerted spiking could be
               a powerful mechanism to transmit visual information rapidly and
               efficiently. Here, we tested this hypothesis in mouse by
               recording simultaneous light-evoked responses from hundreds of
               RGCs, at pan-retinal level, using a new generation of
               large-scale, high-density multielectrode array consisting of 4096
               electrodes. Interestingly, we did not find any RGCs exhibiting a
               clear latency tuning to the stimuli, suggesting that in mouse,
               individual RGC pairs may not provide sufficient information. We
               show that a significant amount of information is encoded
               synergistically in the concerted spiking of large RGC
               populations. Thus, the RGC population response described with
               relative activities, or ranks, provides more relevant information
               than classical independent spike count- or latency- based codes.
               In particular, we report for the first time that when considering
               the relative activities across the whole population, the wave of
               first stimulus-evoked spikes is an accurate indicator of stimulus
               content. We show that this coding strategy coexists with
               classical neural codes, and that it is more efficient and faster.
               Overall, these novel observations suggest that already at the
               level of the retina, concerted spiking provides a reliable and
               fast strategy to rapidly transmit new visual scenes.",

               and ventral RGC responses. At eye-opening, dorsal RGCs of all

               development and disease, drug development, or as a resource for
               patients suffering from disease or injury. Great efforts are
               being made to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells in vitro
               toward retinal tissue, which is akin to native human retina in
               its cytoarchitecture and function, yet the numerous existing
               retinal induction protocols remain variable in their efficiency
               and do not routinely produce morphologically or functionally
               mature photoreceptors. Herein, we determine the impact that the
               method of embryoid body (EB) formation and maintenance as well as
               cell line background has on retinal organoid differentiation from
               human embryonic stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem

               dominate the variables that underline the differentiation
               efficiency in the early stages of differentiation. In contrast,
               the EB generation method and maintenance conditions determine the
               later differentiation and maturation of retinal organoids. Of the
               latter, the mechanical method of EB generation under static
               conditions, accompanied by media supplementation with Y27632 for
               the first 48 hours of differentiation, results in the most

              random, uncorrelated stimuli, the STA provides an unbiased RF
              estimate, but in practice, white noise at high resolution is not
              an optimal stimulus choice as it usually evokes only weak
              responses. Therefore, for a visual stimulus, images of randomly
              modulated blocks of pixels are often used. This solution naturally
              limits the resolution at which an RF can be measured. Here, we
              present a simple super-resolution technique that can overcome
              these limitations. We define a novel stimulus type, the shifted
              white noise (SWN), by introducing random spatial shifts in the
              usual stimulus to increase the resolution of the measurements. In
              simulated data, we show that the average error using the SWN was
              1.7 times smaller than when using the classical stimulus, with
              successful mapping of 2.3 times more neurons, covering a broader
              range of RF sizes. Moreover, successful RF mapping was achieved
              with brief recordings of light responses, lasting only about 1 min
              of activity, which is more than 10 times more efficient than the
              classical white noise stimulus. In recordings from mouse retinal
              ganglion cells with large scale multielectrode arrays, we
              successfully mapped 21 times more RFs than when using the
              traditional white noise stimuli. In summary, randomly shifting the

               Our novel strategy allows grouping of cells sharing gene

               basic and complex visual scenes. Our approach consists of several
               consecutive steps. First, the spike firing frequency is increased
               in RGCs co-expressing a certain gene (Scnn1a or Grik4) using
               excitatory DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by
               designer drugs) in order to single out activity originating

               characterize their anatomical and functional features. We grouped

               similarities. Using this novel approach, we were able to extend
               the pre-existing list of Grik4-expressing RGC types to a total of

  abstract = "Individual retinal cell types exhibit semi-regular spatial
              patterns called retinal mosaics. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and
              starburst amacrine cells (SACs) are known to exhibit such layouts.
              Mechanisms responsible for the formation of mosaics are not well
              understood but follow three main principles: (i) homotypic cells
              prevent nearby cells from adopting the same type, (ii) cell
              tangential migration and (iii) cell death. Alongside experiments
              in mouse, we use BioDynaMo, an agent-based simulation framework,
              to build a detailed and mechanistic model of mosaic formation. We
              investigate the implications of the three theories for RGC's
              mosaic formation. We report that the cell migration mechanism
              yields the most regular mosaics. In addition, we propose that
              low-density RGC type mosaics exhibit on average low regularities,
              and thus we question the relevance of regular spacing as a
              criterion for a group of RGCs to form a RGC type. We investigate
              SAC mosaics formation and interactions between the ganglion cell
              layer (GCL) and inner nuclear layer (INL) populations. We propose
              that homotypic interactions between the GCL and INL populations
              during mosaics creation are required to reproduce the observed SAC
              mosaics' characteristics. This suggests that the GCL and INL
              populations of SACs might not be independent during retinal
              development.",

  abstract  = "Cells in the human retina must rapidly adapt to constantly
               changing visual stimuli. This fast adaptation to varying levels
               and wavelengths of light helps to regulate circadian rhythms and
               allows for adaptation to high levels of illumination, thereby
               enabling the rest of the visual system to remain responsive. It
               has been shown that retinal microRNA (miRNA) molecules play a key
               role in regulating these processes. However, despite extensive
               research using various model organisms, light-regulated miRNAs in
               human retinal cells remain unknown. Here, we aim to characterize
               these miRNAs. We generated light-responsive human retinal
               organoids that express miRNA families and clusters typically
               found in the retina. Using an in-house developed photostimulation
               device, we identified a subset of light-regulated miRNAs.
               Importantly, we found that these miRNAs are differentially
               regulated by distinct wavelengths of light and have a rapid
               turnover, highlighting the dynamic and adaptive nature of the
               human retina.",

  abstract  = "Retinal drug toxicity screening is essential for the development
               of safe treatment strategies for a large number of diseases. To
               this end, retinal organoids derived from human pluripotent stem
               cells (hPSCs) provide a suitable screening platform due to their
               similarity to the human retina and the ease of generation in
               large-scale formats. In this study, two hPSC cell lines were
               differentiated to retinal organoids, which comprised all key
               retinal cell types in multiple nuclear and synaptic layers.
               Single-cell RNA-Seq of retinal organoids indicated the
               maintenance of retinal ganglion cells and development of bipolar
               cells: both cell types segregated into several subtypes.
               Ketorolac, digoxin, thioridazine, sildenafil, ethanol, and
               methanol were selected as key compounds to screen on retinal
               organoids because of their well-known retinal toxicity profile
               described in the literature. Exposure of the hPSC-derived retinal
               organoids to digoxin, thioridazine, and sildenafil resulted in
               photoreceptor cell death, while digoxin and thioridazine
               additionally affected all other cell types, including Müller glia
               cells. All drug treatments caused activation of astrocytes,
               indicated by dendrites sprouting into neuroepithelium. The
               ability to respond to light was preserved in organoids although
               the number of responsive retinal ganglion cells decreased after
               drug exposure. These data indicate similar drug effects in
               organoids to those reported in in vivo models and/or in humans,
               thus providing the first robust experimental evidence of their
               suitability for toxicological studies.",
