It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Professor
Evelyne Sernagor on March 1, 2025, Professor of Retinal Neuroscience
at the Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University, U.K.

Professor Sernagor completed her Ph.D. in Neurophysiology at the
Hebrew University in 1988. She held two postdoctoral positions in the
U.S. in the labs of M. O’Donovan (NIH) and N. Grzywacz
(Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute). Her work set the stage for
her life-long focus on spontaneous activity in motor and retinal
neurons. In her own lab at Newcastle University, she uncovered the
cellular interactions that control the spatiotemporal dynamics of
retinal spontaneous activity and the impact of spontaneous activity on
ganglion cell development. She showed the importance of
gamma-aminobutyric acid in retinal development and how it switches
from an 'excitatory' to its classic 'inhibitory' action in the
maturing retina.  A collaboration with L. Berdondini and 3Brain
utilized a 4096-electrode array to reveal spatiotemporal dynamics of
retinal waves at high spatial and temporal resolution. These studies
and her work with computational experts and theorists to analyze large
volumes of data collected by these arrays are the benchmark for
characterizing retinal waves and light responses early in
development. Professor Sernagor’s most recent collaboration (M. Lako)
used these arrays to study the development of retinal human organoids,
and they developed cell-transplantation strategies to restore
vision.

Evelyne (or “Madame” to her close friends) possessed an unshakable
passion for understanding retinal development and its repair in
disease. She was full of questions, which she addressed with
imagination, innovation, and boundless enthusiasm. She cared deeply
for her lab members, colleagues, and the Vision community, extending
her expertise worldwide, including South Africa and Nigeria, where she
taught for 17 years with IBRO.

Professor Sernagor will be deeply missed as a colleague, leader,
advocate for vision research, and much-treasured friend.
